            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> 
                Chicken adobo, also known as adobong manok, is a quintessential filipino braised chicken, <br>marinated and stewed with vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, black peppercorns.
                The word adobo actually came from the spanish word "adobar," meaning to marinate or pickle. <br>So adobo is a style of cooking that involves marinating meat or veggies in an acidic and/or salty liquid as part of the cooking process.
                This cooking process helps to preserve the food, which was super beneficial in the past when<br> refrigeration wasn't available. The high acid and salt content of the marinating/braising liquid prevents bacteria from growing. So families would make a large amount of adobong manok and let it sit out to be enjoyed throughout the day.

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Marinate the chicken in soy sauce and garlic. The garlic needs to be crushed for best results. This process takes 1 hour to 12 hours depending on how <br>
                    flavorful you want the dish to be. Sometimes marinating for an hour is not enough. I think that 3 hours is optimal. <br>
                    The chicken absorbs most of the flavors from the soy sauce and garlic during <br>
                    this step. It is noticeable when you taste the dish after cooking. Note that it is also possible to include the vinegar in this step.</li>
                <li>Pan-fry the chicken. Fry for 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side. This will partially cook the outer part. It also makes the skin tough enough to <br>
                    withstand stewing later. This means that it will remain intact, which is nice for presentation.</li>
                <li>Season and serve. Add sugar and salt. I only add salt if needed. It is important to taste your dish before adding seasonings. <br>
                    Filipino chicken adobo can be served with or without sauce. If you like it very tasty then continue to cook on an uncovered <br>
                     cooking pot until the liquid</li>
                <li>Eat</li>
            </ol>
